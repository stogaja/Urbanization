# URBANIZATION

## Description

The primary aim of this study was to comprehensively grasp and draw conclusions from the prevailing urbanization patterns in Kenya. This was achieved through meticulous data cleaning, in-depth analysis, and the creation of insightful visualizations. These visual representations were instrumental in formulating the conclusions outlined below.

## ANALYSIS SUMMARY

1. The analysis has been thoroughly done, cleaning and understanding the structure has been accomplished.

2. We have made visualizations using several charts indicating trends and showing population differences and trends in rural and urban areas. 

3. There are some noticeable patterns, like younger families preferring to live in urban areas and the number of females being more than the number of males in urban areas, the other dataset however had some anomalies showing people preferring rural areas to urban areas, but that is subject to study from different data sources.

4. Urbanization has affected healthcare and education positively. The rise in the number of young families living in urban areas is an indicator of availability of healthcare and educational needs that meet the requirements of the occupants. 

5. There is a low number of people above the age of 60 living in urban areas. They mostly reside in rural areas. This might be cause for the conflict in observations.

6. From the analysis, major cities such as Nairobi are growing at a faster rate. 

7. Urbanization has presented challenges such as increased environmental pollution, spikes in crime rates alongside other problems, the elderly are also being neglected and sent back to the rural areas which in turn creates an imbalanced growth rate between rural and urban areas.

8. Urbanization presents opportunities for growth in terms of technology and availability of social amenities which improve the quality of life for people living there. 

9. Policy makers should address the issue of youth unemployment which is a problem that comes from urbanization. It reflects positively on the productivity of the country.
